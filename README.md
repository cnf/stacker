# Stacker

Stacker is a container manager for [Docker][]

This is currently beta software. You can find me as `cnf` on the channel `#docker` on `irc.freenode.net`

pull requests, especially for documentation, are welcome. For new features, open a ticket or poke me on irc.

`docker pull frosquin/stacker:dev` gets you the dev version, which is mostly up to date with the devel branch.

`make image` will build a docker image of your own.

You can find the [full documentation here](https://github.com/cnf/stacker/wiki)

## Configuration
